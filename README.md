## Overview
Account Abstraction (AA) is the movement within Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains to improve transaction user experience by using smart contract wallets as opposed to externally-owned accounts (EOAs) as primary accounts. [EIP-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337)) is the leading standard for implementing AA wallets, which would have the added benefits of not needing consensus-layer protocol changes, user experience improvements through bundled transactions, free/subsidized/token-paid gas costs, and optional privacy and signature enchancing features.
